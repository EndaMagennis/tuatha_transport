## Background to Tuatha

The inspiration to create a website based on this industry comes from personal experience. My father founded and owned a leadiing art transportation company before retirement,
giving me a unique insight into the inner workings of such a company. Tuatha is a slightly more corporate, and expansive version of the former family business. As a Galway-based company,
the logo bares the Galway colours of maroon and white. The name Tuatha, which translates to 'tribe', is also a refernce to Galway being the 'City of Tribes'.
