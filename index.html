            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Tuatha began as little more than a man with a van and a drive to succeed. 
                After aquiring an arctic lorry license through a social scheme, Gene purchased a box lorry to do odd jobs for friends and family.<br> 
                <span class="gene-quote">"Many of my friends happened to be musicians and artists and many needed help moving house. From pianos and tables, to paintings and sculptures, I had
                garnerd experience in moving delicate and expensive works the length and bredth of the country,
                gaining knowledge on how to handle different materials safely from the creators and admirers themselves."</span> - Gene Ericman
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero-image"></div>
        <div class="text-chunk" id="text-chunk-right">
            <h3>How far we've come</h3>
            <p>Since then Tuatha has continued to grow in expertise and in scope, serving over 20 countries, on two continents. 
                We regularly make runs to the UK, mainland Europe and partner with trusted art handlers in the US.
                We haven't forgotten our roots, however, and still accomodate domestic runs for personal collections.<br>
                <span class="gene-quote">"We know that every work holds personal significance and so we strive to handle each peice with the same care and consideration
                as we have done since moving works for friends and family all those years ago."</span> -Gene Ericman
