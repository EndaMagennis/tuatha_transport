            <p>Installations and removals are the heart of any art transport services and at Tuatha,
                we pride ourselves in expert art handling. Not all collections are paintings hung on a wall, 
                often collections include complex sculptures and non-conventional hanging methods. Our prices consider the number of pieces, 
                the range of sizes and display requirements, and the number of handlers needed for the job.</p>

            <h3 class="services-heading">Transport and Shipping</h3>
            <p>Collections are rarely static and need to be moved from gallery to gallery. 
                At Tuatha, we have a fleet of over ten temperature-controlled vans and box-trucks, custom fitted with racking to secure you artworks 
                while in transit. For shipping in Ireland, the UK and Europe, our drivers use ferry networks, to transport works safely in our trucks. 
                We also work with two trusted shipping companies for transport to the US.</p>

            <h3 class="services-heading">Storage</h3>
            <p>Installations often need an interim period while the receiving gallery make preparations for their arrival. 
                Gallery's own storage facilities are often full to capacity with the flux of travelling works and installation. 
                At Tuatha, we have dedicated, temperature and moisture-controlled storage facilities in Ireland, the UK and mainland 
                Europe to safely store a full range of works. Our prices consider number, of pieces, overall dimensions of the collection and storage time.</p>

            <h3 class="services-heading">Crating</h3>
            <p>Art is not bound by standard dimensions, shapes, sizes or materials. 
                As such, different pieces can require bespoke crates for transport and storage. 
                Tuatha are fully equipped with woodworking facilities to build tailor-made crates, 
                with stabilizing foam inserts to protect your artworks. Our prices consider the dimensions of the piece 
                and the materials required, and shipping costs.</p>
